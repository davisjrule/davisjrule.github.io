description: I worked on a research team at the University of Michigan where we studied the shortcomings of current machine learning interpretability frameworks. I was involved in data collection and cleaning, model development, survey distribution, and analysis of results. I also contributed to authoring a research paper for publication in various HCI (Human Computer Interaction) conferences.
