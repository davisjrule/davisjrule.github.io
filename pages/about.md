# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor working towards a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in English through the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. I'm passionate about using my knowledge to develop elegant solutions to real-world problems. I've worked on a research team at the University of Michigan studying machine learning, but most recently I've begun work in the software industry through my first internship at Walmart Global Tech. I'm an avid musician, and in my free time I produce music for release on major streaming platforms. I'm also an amateur photographer, and I enjoy capturing portraits of my friends and family.
