          At Walmart, I worked on the Digital Experience Scoring (DEx) team, which works to provide critical insights
          about
          product health to product owners throughout Walmart. While on the DEx team, I developed a scheduled Node.js
          program to
          automate data collection for 20+ product teams. This automation, integrated with multiple APIs and BigQuery
          tables,
          significantly improved data accuracy and efficiency, reducing hours of manual work each month. I refined my
          strategy for
          my automation initiative after presenting to the Architecture Review Board, which is comprised of over 80
          engineers to
          ensure adherence to high standards of work. I also played a vital role in onboarding new product owners,
          ensuring
          seamless adoption of DEx across the division. My work culminated in presenting strategic insights to senior
          stakeholders, including the VP of the Associate Digital Experience division, setting the stage for future
          automation
          initiatives for the DEx team.

        While on the Michigan Data Science Team, I developed a classification model using convolutional neural networks
        (CNNs)
        to classify images as either dogs or cats. I expanded this project to include a dog breed classifier, ultimately
        achieving over 60% accuracy in dog breed prediction with transfer learning. I also built a Discord Chatbot
        employing
        advanced Natural Language Processing, including LSTM networks and transformers, and deployed it using Amazon Web
        Services (AWS). I worked with the SQuAD2.0 (Stanford Question Answering) dataset as training data, and I focused
        on
        utilizing this data to train the chatbot on a wide variety of topics.

          In my research, I studied the intricacies of machine learning interpretability, a crucial yet challenging
          aspect of AI.
          My work primarily focused on examining the limitations of standard interpretability frameworks in the
          industry. I
          generated detailed interpretability visuals for a machine learning model, employing tools such as SHapley
          Additive
          exPlanations (SHAP) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). An integral part of my research involved writing
          Jupyter
          notebooks to assess participants' use of interpretability tools. These notebooks were distributed on a large
          scale
          through a Qualtrics survey, facilitating comprehensive data collection. At the conclusion of this project, I
          co-authored
          a paper, which will be published in PACM HCI (Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction).

          In my role as a Film Production Assistant, I worked to ensure the seamless operation of commercial video
          productions
          throughout New England. My responsibilities included the transportation of film equipment between various
          locations,
          ensuring everything was available where and when it was needed. I closely communicated with directors and
          producers,
          coordinating the proper placement of lighting and cameras on set. This role not only required physical
          management of
          equipment but also involved ensuring client satisfaction and comfort during shoots.
